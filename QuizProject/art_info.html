			Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, is the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. This painting is painted as oil on wood. 
			The original painting size is 77 x 53 cm (30 x 20 7/8 in) and is owned by by the Government of France and is on the wall 
			in the Louvre in Paris, France. This figure of a woman, dressed in the Florentine fashion of her day and seated in a visionary, 
			mountainous landscape, is a remarkable instance of Leonardo's sfumato technique of soft, heavily shaded modeling. The Mona Lisa's 
			enigmatic expression, which seems both alluring and aloof, has given the portrait universal fame.

			Vincent van Gogh was one of the world’s greatest artists, with paintings such as ‘Starry Night’ and ‘Sunflowers,’ though he was 
			unknown until after his death. He was a post-Impressionist painter whose work — notable for its beauty, emotion and color — highly 
			influenced 20th-century art. He struggled with mental illness and remained poor and virtually unknown throughout his life.
			Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. Van Gogh’s father, Theodorus van Gogh, was an austere country minister, 
			and his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was a moody artist whose love of nature, drawing and watercolors was transferred to her son.
			Van Gogh was born exactly one year after his parents' first son, also named Vincent, was stillborn. At a young age — with his name and 
			birthdate already etched on his dead brother's headstone — van Gogh was melancholy. This artist is well known for his action of severing 
			his own ear for one of his paintings.

			The Sistine Chapel ceiling (Italian: Volta della Cappella Sistina), painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is a cornerstone work 
			of High Renaissance art. The ceiling is that of the Sistine Chapel, the large papal chapel built within the Vatican between 1477 and 1480 
			by Pope Sixtus IV, for whom the chapel is named. It was painted at the commission of Pope Julius II. The chapel is the location for papal 
			conclaves and many other important services.

			Pablo Ruiz Picasso was born on 25 October 1881 and passed away on 8 April 1973. He was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, 
			stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th 
			century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[6][7] the co-invention of collage, and for 
			the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon 
			(1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces during the Spanish Civil War.

			The second secondary color in the palette is purple. Purple can be created by mixing the primary colors of red and blue. An equal mixture of 
			pure red paint and pure blue paint will result in a pure purple. However, this ‘pure purple’ is often darker than most people like. To get a 
			nice, bright purple, you will want to use a magenta color instead. You can then mix the magenta with a blue or a cyan, and voila! You will 
			have bright purple. If you do not have access to the less common colors, such as magenta and cyan, another option for creating a brighter 
			or lighter purple is to combine your blue and red paints and then add in a bit of white to lighten the darker color.
