			If you sometimes struggle with basic math skills, there is hope! You can learn the basic operations that you see all of the time
			in this one stop shop! Below you can find an explanation of each basic math operator and if you are feeling up to the challenge, you can even
			take a quiz to test your skills!

		<p>
			Addition is a mathematical operation that explains the total amount of objects when they are put together in a collection.
			For example, let’s say that Jimmy has 2 apples and Laura has 3 apples, and that we want to find out how many apples they have together.
			By adding them together, we see that both of them combined have 5 apples (2 Jimmy’s apple + 3 Laura’s apples = 5 apples in total).
			The symbol that is used with the addition operation is "+".
		</p>
		<p>
			Subtraction is the arithmetic operation that is the opposite of addition. Subtraction is used when you want to know how many objects 
			are left in the group after you take away a certain amount of objects from that group. For example, Maggie has 5 apples and she gives 
			2 apples to her friend Paul. How many apples does she have? She has 3 apples (5 apples that she had – 2 apples that she gave to Paul = 
			3 apples that are left to her). The symbol that is used with the subtraction operation is "-".
		</p>

			Multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to the addition of a number to itself as many times as the value of the other one number is.
			Think of it like this: you have 5 groups of apples and each group has 3 apples. One of the ways you can find out how many apples you have is 
			this one:
			3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples = 15 apples in total. You can see that it is way too much work (especially if you have 
			larger numbers), so you can use multiplication to solve this problem: 5 group of apples x 3 apples in every group = 15 apples in total.
			The symbol that is used with the multiplication operation is "*".
		</p>
		<p>
			Division is the fourth basic math operation. Basically, you can say that dividing means splitting objects into equal parts or groups. 
			For example, you have 12 apples that need to be shared equally between 4 people. So, how many apples will each person get? Each person 
			will get 3 apples (12 apples / 4 people = 3 apples per person). The division is the opposite of multiplication.
			The symbol that is used with the division operation is "/".
