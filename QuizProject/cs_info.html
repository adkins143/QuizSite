        <p>
			This page just contains some basic programming information that is good to be aware of going into Computer Science.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			System.out.println is a Java statement that prints the argument passed and is what the user sees once the program has been ran.
			You do this, typically, if you are requesting input from the user, if you want to let them know specifics, or just if you want to
			have something displayed in general.
		</p>
		<p>
			In programming, you have a variety of types of variables. For example, if you want to create a variable that is going to equal a word you
			will want to set it to type "string". However, if you want to create a variable and make it be equal to a certain integer, you will want
			to make it of type Int.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are developing a program and somewhere in the midst of it you want to do some math, then that is completely fine!
			In order to add numbers together in a program, you basically follow the same method that you would as if you were writing it out
			on paper or a calculator. For example:<br>
			<br>
			Say we have two integers....int a = 0......int b = 5......and we want to add them and make the result its own variable. You simple do:<br>
			<br>
			int c = a + b;.........This will add a and b together and make their result equal variable c. Just be careful that everything is the same variable type or
			you will run into issues!
		</p>
		<p>
			In computer science, we have the ability to construct our data in a variety of ways. We can create data dictionaries, arrays, vectors, graphs,
			queues, stacks, linked lists, etc. Each structure has its own advantage and its own disadvantage so you will want to choose which is best when 
			you are beginning to design your program. However, if you are wanting to devise a program where you are utilizing a "first in, first out" 
			methodology, then you will want to choose a queue. If you are wanting to utilize a "last in, first out" methodology, then you will want to 
			choose a stack. If you are wanting to construct a list and then manipulate for however you see fit, then you may want to choose an array or 
			perhaps a vector.
		</p>
		<p>
			When devloping your software and business you really want to consider which methodology you want to use. Each client and situation is different
			so making sure you choose the best option is key. The following is a rundown of a variety of methodologies:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Waterfall Model</li>
			<li>Protocol Methodology</li>
			<li>Agile Software Development</li>
			<li>Rapid Application Development</li>
			<li>Spiral Model</li>
			<li>Extreme Programming</li>
			<li>Feature Driven Development</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Now, if you are looking for the fastest model/method, you will want to use the Rapid Application Development methodology.
			If you are looking for an easy way to determine where you currently are in your model, you will want to choose the Waterfall Model.
			Once again, each model/method has its own advantages/disadvantages so be sure to choose the best one for your situation/business!
