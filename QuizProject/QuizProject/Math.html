			If you sometimes struggle with basic math skills, there is hope! You can learn the basic operations that you see all of the time
			in this one stop shop! Below you can find an explanation of each basic math operator and if you are feeling up to the challenge, you can even
			take a quiz to test your skills!
        </p>
		<p>
			The " + " operator means addition. You will take one number, and add it to another number. For example, 1 + 1 = 2.
		</p>
		<p>
			The " - " operator means subtraction. You will reduce the value of one number by the valu of another. For example, 1 - 1 = 0.
		</p>
		<p>
			The " * " operator means multiplication. You will continue to add a number by as many times as another number.
				For example, 2 * 5 means 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 which is 10.
		</p>
		<p>
			The " / " operator means division. You will divide a number into groups and see how many groups we are able to create.
				For example, 10 / 2 means we can create 5 groups of 2. So 2 goes into 10, 5 times. So the answer is 5.
