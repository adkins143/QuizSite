    <main>
        <p> Have you ever wondered what exactly a rock is made up of? Maybe you have pondered about why volcanoes act the way they do. When it 
            comes to Earth and its infinite mysteries, we have done more than scratch the surface to answer these questions. We group all of
            these curiosities underneath what is called Earth and Environmental Science. EES studies geology and an understanding of planet Earth 
            from the smallest mineral to the largest mountain. The following information you will see will give you further, yet brief, insight 
            to the material you will see if you decide to pursue a life in the geological realm.

            To kick things off, lets start with something small; small as in minerals. Minerals are the building blocks that make up one type
            of rock known as igneous rock. They are classified as naturally occuring, solid, inorganic, having a crystalline structure, 
            and having a definite composition. You can identify different types of minerals by quite a few methods. For starters, you can look
            at a minerals color but it can be tricky at times since some minerals have multiple colors. Because of this you may want to look at 
            if the mineral has luster; that is, does the mineral reflect light. Another option for identifying a mineral is checking to see if 
            it has a streak or not. What this means is the mineral will leave a trail of powder as it is pressed against a scratch plate and if it 
            does not then the mineral has no streak. The next method to use is testing the minerals hardness. To do so, we use what is called the 
            Mohs Scale which rates a mineral's hardness from 0-10. To get an idea of this, a diamond will rank 10 on the Mohs Scale. Proceeding 
            this method is checking if the mineral has cleavage or fracture. If the mineral has cleavage, it will appear more smooth but if it is 
            not very smooth then we say the mineral has fracture. Finally you can identify a mineral based on whether or not it reacts to acid. 
            Typically, we see minerals react to acid when the contain calcite. So, if a drop of acid on the rock starts to fizz we know the rock 
            will contain calcite. As you can see, minerals play a very crucial role in geology and you cannot study rocks without first touching 
            on them.

            Once minerals and rocks have been mastered, another topic that is fun to study in geology is earthquakes. Earthquakes are both 
            interesting and terrifying because if you have ever experienced one for yourself then you know exactly how unnerving 
            one can be. However, they are in fact interesting because an earthquake can take place without you ever even knowing it is happening.
            A few terms you want to know regarding these seismic events is a foreshock, aftershock, focus, epicenter, and seismometer. A foreshock 
            is a smaller earthquake before the main one hits. That being said, an aftershock is simply just a small earthquake that occurs once 
            the main one has already passed. When studying these, we want to know where they originate from and to do so we need to figure out 
            a few things. For starters, we need to figure out where the earthquake originated from within the earth which is its focus. Once we 
            have that information, we need to determine where it originated from on the surface which is its epicenter. Finally, we can determine 
            how intense and the quake's magnitude size by using what is called a seismometer. As I have said before, earthquakes are both interesting 
            and terrifying because you do not want to find yourself in the middle of one that has a large magnitude because you will be in for a 
            real hurting.

            Now, you may be asking telling yourself that this content, so far, is easy. If that is the case, we can heat up the material by 
            talking about something really hot like volcanoes. Volcanoes are extremely exciting when studying geology because they can be 
            extremely catastrophic. These structures can both create and destroy from providing oceanic islands, as well as farmland, to ruining 
            property and even taking lives. There are a few different types of volcanoes like Shields, Cinder Cones, Strato/Composites, and 
            Volcanic/Lava Domes. Shield volcanoes are flat and are mildly explosive that create basaltic lava flow. Cinder Cones are similar in 
            that they are mildly explosive but they have little basaltic lava flow and create certain pyroclastics which are fire fragments.
            Strato/Composite volcanoes are the ones you really want to watch out for because they are very explosive and are known to be high 
            in pyroclasts; the look of a Strato/Composite volcanoe is what you typically see which is a steep sloping summit. Finally, 
            Volcanic/Lava Domes are similar to Strato/Composite volcanoes in respect to being very explosive but they volcanoes are just lava 
            bulges in the crater of the volcanoe. If that melted your heart indefinitely, then geology may be right for you.

            One final topic upon the many that are discussed in geology that is pretty cool are glaciers. Most people hear the term glacier and 
            thing of the tragedy that was the Titanic. But really glaciers are much more than that. Glaciers can be small, such as Valley 
            Glaciers, or really big, such as Continental Ice Sheets. Glaciers only exist because of a certain process that few people even know 
            takes place. To begin, snowflakes will thaw and refreeze creating what is known as firn. Firn will get buried down thus recrystalizing 
            into what is called glacial ice. Over time that glacial ice will move and fracture which could then come into contact with other fractures 
            creating larger pieces. This process is very slow and takes a long time to reach its end but it does infact happen. There are other aspects 
            to glaciers such as a glacial budget which is the balance between how much the glacier is moving forward, advancing, or melting, retreating. 
            There are also features that form to do erosion with glaciers such as aretes, cirques, tarns, horns, and many others. Glaciers are a really 
            fun topic to check out because they cover about 10% of land surface on our planet!

            Hopefully you payed attention to the material on this page because you have the opportunity to put your smarts to the test! Literally! 
            Below you will see a button that takes you to a five question quiz covering the material you just saw. Test your wits and remember that 
            geology plays a major part of each and every one of our lives! Good luck!
